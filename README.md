# Gifs search engine

Simple search engine. Which uses Giphy API: [Giphy Api](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI).

Possible actions:
* Search gifs by written phrase.
* Choosing how much gifs will be displayed on every page.
* Change (next/previous) page or choose specific page (dropdown select input working at onchange event).

Possible is rating every Gif (Like/Dislike buttons working at onclick event). One person can rate only one gif. Can also change his mind. But not remove selection.
